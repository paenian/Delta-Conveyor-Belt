# Making a Continuous Belt.

This page details how to build a continuous loop conveyor belt from a flat sheet of material.   It will enable you to test out any material on your PrintShift or other belt-based printer, and is widely applicable for joining strips of material.

## Materials Needed
1. Belt Joining Tape.  What sort of tape!?  Three things to consider are:
   * Tape Material
   * Tape Thickness
   * Tape Adhesive
2. Belt.  Again, what sort?
   * You need a strip ~20mm longer than your final loop size, cut to the correct width.
3. Painter's Tape
   * This is used to hold the belt in place while assembling, and discarded afterwards.  1" wide is fine; pictured below use 2" wide.

## Tools Needed
1. Block of wood to cut on.
   * If your printer can't slide a continuous belt on, a thin piece of HDPE or similar (cutting mat) is recommended to protect your bed.
2. Sharp knife capable of cutting your belt.
3. Light.  Do not attempt in darkness.


## Procedure
1. Place belt outside-down on your work surface.
2. Place block of wood on top.
3. Form the belt into an overlapping loop - lining up the straightest edge with itself.
4. Tape the belt into a loop
5. Thoroughly tape the belt to the wood cutting block on either side of the joining tape line.
6. Cut through BOTH layers of the belt.
   * cutting at a slight angle will help maintain belt tension over the seam.
7. Remove the ends of the belt carefully - the goal is not to disturb the joint.
8. Join the belt ends with your Belt Joining Tape.
9. Woo it's a belt!  Carefully remove the blue tape and install it on your printer.
